# Jitpack Experiment

This is a test to see if I can pull [yarngdx](https://github.com/kyperbelt/YarnGdx) as a dependency into my project using jitpack.

The difference between this and the original yarngdx is 3 lines in Lexer.java to fix [this issue](https://github.com/kyperbelt/YarnGdx/issues/2). I only set this up for my own convenience and to play around with Jitpack.
